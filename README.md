This project is for AUT#Home team for AUTCUP2013 face recognition challenge.
Sepanta is the name of AUT@Home Robot. In this project Sepanta was supposed to recognize 5 differnt people and then call their name.

Because of space restriction I did not upload the whole library but feel free to contact me if you have question.
